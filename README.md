This project builds a scalable data engineering pipeline to synchronize and process data in real-time across MySQL, MongoDB, and Redis. Using triggers in MySQL, data changes are captured and streamed via Kafka (64MB–1024MB throughput). Spark processes and validates the data, then writes it to MongoDB and Redis for low-latency access. Ideal for solving real-time data consistency challenges in distributed systems.
